# 🛒 Dart Basics and eCommerce Application

Hello and welcome to my project on **Dart Basics and eCommerce Application**!  'Ecommerce'
This project is part of my journey to learn and practice the **Dart programming language**, which is the foundation of **Flutter development**.

---

## 📘 Overview

In this project, I explored the basic syntax, data types, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Dart.  
As a practical exercise, I built a simple **command-line eCommerce application** that allows users to manage products directly from the console.

The application demonstrates how to:
- ➕ Add new products  
- 👀 View all, completed, or pending products  
- ✏️ Edit product details (name, description, price, image)  
- 🗑️ Delete products  

Each product can also be marked as **completed** or **pending** to simulate order or task management.

## 🧩 Application Structure

### 1. `product.dart`
Defines the `Product` class and its properties:
- `name`
- `description`
- `price`
- `image`
- `status`

### 2. `productManager.dart`
Contains the `ProductManager` class responsible for:
- Adding new products  
- Viewing all, and sngle detail products 
- Editing existing product details  
- Deleting products  

### 3. `main.dart`
Handles user input from the console.  
It provides a menu-based system that allows users to perform all CRUD operations interactively.
